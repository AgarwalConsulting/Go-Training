# Advanced - Refresher

- Concurrency
  - Goroutines
    - `go` keyword
    - M:N scheduler
  - sync
    - `sync.WaitGroup`
    - `sync.Mutex`
      - `sync.RWMutex`
    - Data Race condition: `-race` flag
      - Available across the tool chain
  - Channels
    - Buffered `make(chan <type>, <n>)`
    - Unbuffered `make(chan <type>)`
      - `<-ch`
        - Receiving from a channel; blocks if there is nothing to receive
      - `ch <-`
        - Sending to a channel;
          - blocks if the buffer is full! (Buffered channel)
          - blocks until there is a receive! (Unbuffered channel)
    - `range`
      - Loops for next value received from channel
      - Blocks until the channel is closed
    - `close`
      - receive from closed channel: no blocking; returns zero-value, flag
      - send to a closed channel: panic
    - `cap`
  - Select
    - The select statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.
    - A select blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.
    - The default case in a select is run if no other case is ready.

- Go concurrency patterns
  - Producer-consumer
  - Futures (similar to `async`-`await`)
    - Map Reduce
  - Generators
  - Pipeline example
