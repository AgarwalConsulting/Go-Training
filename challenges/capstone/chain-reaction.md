# [Chain Reaction](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BuddyMattEnt.ChainReaction&hl=en_IN)

Chain Reaction is a turn-based strategy game which can be played between 2 to 8 players.

The objective of Chain Reaction is to take control of the board by eliminating your opponents' orbs.

## Rules

- Players take it in turns to place their orbs in a cell.
- Once a cell has reached critical mass the orbs explode into the surrounding cells adding an extra orb and claiming the cell for the player.
- A player may only place their orbs in a blank cell or a cell that contains orbs of their own colour.
- As soon as a player looses all their orbs they are out of the game.
- The last player standing wins!

## Objectives

- Develop the game using Go while keeping your code clean & `DRY`
- Identify the entities and the interactions they would have
- Take the cell position from the player for the next turn
  - After each turn draw the board to the cli (instead of colors, use symbols to represent each individual player's orbs)
- Add test cases for your code
