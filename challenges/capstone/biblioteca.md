# Enhance [Biblioteca](https://github.com/AgarwalConsulting/Go-Training/tree/master/solutions/advanced/1/chi-router)

Add a way to manage a library card and users of that card.

- The users should be able to see a list of books available for checkout.

- A book can be checked out by any user in the library.

- A book can be returned by the user and can then be available for checkout.

## Note

- Add persistence to the application

- Add a UI for the application

### Security

Spend some time trying to attack your own server. Can you attempt to brute force the authentication? Can you impersonate the server to an unsuspecting user? Can you make a denial of service attack against it? Anything else?

Implement mitigations for these problems.
