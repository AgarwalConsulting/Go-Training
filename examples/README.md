# Overview

Go is a compiled language. Every program needs to be compiled before it can be run!

## Running & Building

- `go build` & `go run` commands
  - `GOOS` & `GOARCH` env variables

## Naming Conventions

- package names, directories, filenames => snake_case
- exported functions, variables, const, types => PascalCase / UpperCamelCase
- non-exported functions, variables, const, types => lowerCamelCase
