# Interpreter

Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

## Problem

- Textual input needs to be processed

## When to use

- Use this to turn grammar into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

- Turning strings into linked structures in a complicated process
